# Overview

I have used C++ in the past but I have not been able to use it for a couple years. I made this little demo to get me back into using c++ and making sure my skills are still intact. It is a simple little program that does not do anything in particular, but it uses various foundations of c++. These include: variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, classes, functions and such. I am happy with where it is going.

# Future Work

Add something where it can read and write to a file, that is a useful attribute to have.
